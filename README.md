What this program does is it prints a 8x8 grid to the screen(Console in C#) 
of a chessboard where 8 Queens could all fit on the board.
This takes into account that Queens can attack horozontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each board that it creates is made dynamically from random positions for each Queen.
Each time the program is run it will produce a different board.

I originally wrote this in Java but have rewritten it in C#.
